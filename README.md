## Purpose
This page is intended to provide a more in-depth guideline regarding the Jinja integration in FortiManager.
It is intended to help colleagues, customers and partners XXX
The repository a privately maintained guideline and has no association to the official fortinet documentation.
Furthermore, realistic examples from customer use-cases are shown and explained, which can provide a deeper insight into the Jinja configuration.

## Support
The following utilities are supported on FortiManager:
- All of Jinja 2.11 operations, built-in filters and tests.
- Ansible's ipaddr filters.
- Python 3.8's built-in functions.
- Jinjaâ€™s import and include.

## Important
### Whitespace Control
FortiManager uses the default Jinja configuration for whitespace control:
- A single trailing newline is stripped if present.
- Other whitespace (spaces, tabs, and newlines) are returned unchanged.
Therefore it is very important to manually strip whitespace characters. A minus sign (-) can be added to the start or end of a block, a comment, or a variable expression to remove the whitespace before or after the block.
**Experience has shown that most errors within the generated CLI script arises from whitespace controll misconfigurations.**
